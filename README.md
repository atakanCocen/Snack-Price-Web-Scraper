# Snack-Price-Web-Scraper
Web Scraper that tracks the price of favorite snack.

By making use of Node.js and Puppeteer, a Node library that allows us to control headless Chrome, we can scrape the name and price of any item online. In this instance I'm using it to retrieve data on my favorite snack from multiple sites. Rather than individually navigating to each site to check prices, I'm able to scrape the data from several websites with one command.
